# Google Scholar Profile Scraper

This tool provides a graphical interface to fetch data from Google Scholar profiles. It retrieves profile details, publication information, citation metrics, and saves the results in CSV format. Additionally, you have the option to save the raw HTML output for debugging purposes.

## Features

- **Flexible Input:**  
  Enter either a full Google Scholar profile URL (e.g.,  
  `https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=z7YruZ8AAAAJ&hl=en`) or a direct user ID (e.g., `z7YruZ8AAAAJ`). Multiple inputs can be separated by commas.

- **Data Retrieval:**  
  The script fetches:
  - The userâ€™s name and affiliation.
  - Research interests.
  - Citation counts, h-index, and i10-index metrics.
  - A list of publications with title, authors, journal, citations, and publication year.

- **CSV Export:**  
  Results for each profile are saved as a CSV file in a dedicated folder (`google-scholar-search-results`).

- **HTML Debugging Option:**  
  When fetching publication data, you are prompted to save the raw HTML output. This can help with debugging if the page content is not as expected.

## Requirements

- **Python:**  
  Python 3.8 or later is recommended.  
  *Note: If using an older Python version, you may encounter issues with certain type hints (e.g., `Literal` in the typing module).*

- **Dependencies:**  
  The script requires the following packages:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  
  The script includes a prompt to help install any missing dependencies automatically.

## Installation

**Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JakeMartinResearch/g-scholar-pull-user.git
   cd g-scholar-pull-user
   ```
  
  ## Useage

  - **Run the Script:**
     Launch the application by running:

```bash
python google-scholar-pull-gui.py
```
- **Enter Profile Information:**
In the GUI, enter a full Google Scholar profile URL or user ID. If you have multiple profiles to fetch, separate them with commas.

- **Fetch Data:**
Click the "Fetch Profile(s)" button. The script will:
  - Retrieve profile data from Google Scholar.
  - Optionally prompt you to save the raw HTML output for debugging.
  - Display the fetched information in the GUI.
